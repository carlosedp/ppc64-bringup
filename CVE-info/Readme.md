# Spectre Mitigations

Here is a comparison between all three mitigations that can be applied to the POWER9 CPU against Spectre.

To configure, check <https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Configuring_Spectre_Protection_Level>.

* Init level 0 — Kernel and User protection (safest, default)
* Init level 1 — Kernel protection only
* Init level 2 — No protection

After configuring it on BMC, a power cycle(power off then power on) is required.

The report was provided by the script on <https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker>.

Test by running:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker/master/spectre-meltdown-checker.sh
sudo sh spectre-meltdown-checker.sh
```
